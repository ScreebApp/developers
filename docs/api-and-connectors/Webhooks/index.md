Screeb Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about survey responses that received in your Screeb workspace. When an event occurs, we send an HTTP POST request to the webhook's configured URL.

You can configure webhooks at differents levels:
- At the workspace level -> Triggered for all surveys in the workspace
- At the survey level -> Triggered for a specific survey

:::warning
Only Admin users can configure webhooks.
